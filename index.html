            UX Researcher & Designer with a passion for user-centered design. Skilled in data collection, testing, and
            analysis to inform product development. Driven by a relentless curiosity, I explore the intersection of
            human behavior and digital products.

            At the intersection where UX means wya more than intercaton design of screen for people. At an intersectio
            where experinces are crafted? Focused on bridging gap between customer interactions with digital products.
            Designing interecations and processes for people that go far beyond the screens and digital entirely.

            in the world full of flooded ux talent, i can only assume how challenging it can be to find the right fit,

                            the cutting edge version of ourselves through our own capabilities of critically evaluating,
                            analysing the quick results and challange wholestically and lead with most creative paths.
                            It enables us to device and design paths and processes perhaps at the scale never dealt
                            before. I am excitited to work alongside AI using my abilities in the most effective way and
                            rethink the nature of gaps and make world as inclusive as possible not just through
                            end-products
